    "overview": "The Near Total Recall Skill enables you to retrieve and recall specific topics (memories) from a dataset using natural language queries. By leveraging advanced sentence embeddings and cosine similarity, this skill identifies and presents the most relevant memories based on your input.",
    "features": "- **Memory Retrieval**: Efficiently find memories related to your queries. - **Similarity Thresholds**: Configurable thresholds to control the sensitivity of memory matches. - **Response Templates**: Customizable templates for presenting recalled memories.",
